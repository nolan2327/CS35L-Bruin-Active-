   TODO

**Create a Project**


### Run the App 

Run frontend and backend together:

    npm start

## Code Structure
For the frontend, we used React CreateApp. For the backend, we used nodejs. For the scripting and web scrapers, we used Python.

## To Note
The scrapers actively go to the web from your computer, so it may take a few seconds to load. Be patient! The same happens with the calendar.
